# OC-Zine
Hypothetical OpenComputers fanzine and/or technical journal.

## Submissions
### Topics
Anything OpenComputers-related is okay, for example:

 - Software
 - Projects
 - Tutorials
 - "Here's this neat thing I did"

### Ads
Magazine-style ads for OpenComputers products and services will also be accepted, as it significantly contributes to the 1980s computer magazine aesthetic. A limit of one ad per product/service per issue will be imposed, and ads should be of suitable quality to be seen in a low-budget magazine.

Some (soft) requirements:

 - Ads should be suitable for A4 paper
 - Full-page ads may be submitted in PDF format

### File Format
Submissions should be in some form of plain text format, as they will be converted to LaTeX, using pandoc, for typesetting.

Included images should be in either XCF, PNG, JPEG or SVG formats, depending on use.
