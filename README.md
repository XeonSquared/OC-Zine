# OC-Zine
Hypothetical OpenComputers fanzine and/or technical journal.

## Submissions
### Topics
Anything OpenComputers-related is okay, for example:

 - Software
 - Projects
 - Tutorials
 - "Here's this neat thing I did"

Additionally, magazine-style ads for OpenComputers products and services will be accepted, as it significantly contributes to the 1980s computer magazine aesthetic. A limit of one ad per product/service per issue will be imposed, and ads should be of suitable quality to be seen in a low-budget magazine.

### File Format
Submissions should be in some form of plain text format, as they will be converted to LaTeX, using pandoc, for typesetting.

Included images should be in either PNG, JPEG or SVG formats, depending on use.
